### Far Vision
Connecting farmers and consumers to make fresh produce more accessible 

### Near Vision (MVP)
To allow a farmer to manage an online farm that includes:
1. Subscription model information and number of slots available if any (e.g. CSA shares, fruit share, meat share)
2. Near real-time information on the farm's offerings for sale in the open market
3.  Connection points for the customer to pick up farm offerings 
    - drop off locations, farm stands, farmers' market
    - day and time
4. Farm location (geolocation) and description (a window-shopping portal for the farm)

### Stakeholder Types 
* Farmers
* Customers of farm products

### A real stakeholder and their persona
* Ari Kurtz, 70, Male, and Moira O'Donnel, 65, Female 
* Occupation: Farmers, in Lincoln MA
Ari and Moira grow many types of vegetables and fruits during the farming season. They runs a CSA (Community supported agriculture) and also sells produce in the farmer's market. they also give a part of their produce to a local charity. As a farmer they offers CSA subscriptions through a mailing list and the local newspaper of the town. They have experienced the following problems: 
1. Outreach: Over the past few years they has seen their CSA membership decline. As a farmer outreach is a big challenge especially in the digital era, where the proportion of people accessing information through the traditional media is limited. Also maintaining a website is difficult.
2. Marketing excess produce: When there is surplus produce like hot peppers this year, the issues they face are 
a) They find it very difficut to find someone to buy them, whether small quantities or in bulk. They rely on a mailing list that most farmers in Massachusetts subscribe to, to market their produce
b) How to price the product so that it is attractive enough to buy, but at the same time they are not losing money. They compare prices in local stores and gustimate a selling price for their produce
c)How to make inventory available in realtime to customers  


### Product Backlog
Our product backlog will be managed using Jira (https://txmd-webops.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MYF/boards/1/backlog). We currently have more than 10 PBIs and they are all expressed as a true user story. We ordered the backlog based on the functionality that is needed to create a fluid and logical user experience ("Business Value"), and then taking into account pre-requisite/dependencies between tasks.

#### Definition of ready for our user stories
- Has a title
- Is a testable user story
- Is Estimated
- Has clear and unambigous acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and pre-requisites are ready
- Has additional details
- Has been discussed at sprint planning and team agrees the story is complete (it has an opening sentence and additional details are added) and meets the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small & Testable) criteria

#### Estimation technique
We used the affinity estimation method using buckets/categories on a scale of 1 (Smallest) through 5 (Largest). The developers estimated the first 10 PBIs in story points using relative sizing and grouped them into each bucket. For example, while a PBI with an estimate of 2 story points was placed in bucket 1, a PBI with an estimate of 6 (3x) story points was placed in bucket 3.

Only developers participated in estimating each PBI. 

A recording of the Zoom session where we did most of this estimation can be viewed here : https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/7RBYFAdnjYFj7M_tqM7k6Ete0iwUiOPJSvVqJa8oiax1v3fMKXk3Ua7RgLjeHyHi.oCFtfjU87kVOR5-V. 
Some of the estimation and grouping was done asynchronously via Slack.
