## Far Vision
Connecting farmers and consumers to make fresh produce more accessible, to reduce produce waste and to maximise the profits for farmers' season

## Near Vision
1. Allow farmers to be a part of a marketplace, to advertise their presence and list the produce they want to sell to other farmers or directly to customers. 
2. Allow customers (who could also be farmers) to browse through a list of produce to commit to buy from other farmers.
