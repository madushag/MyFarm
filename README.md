### Far Vision
Connecting farmers and consumers to make fresh produce more accessible 

### Near Vision (MVP)
To allow a farmer to manage an online farm that includes:
1. Subscription model information and number of slots available if any (e.g. CSA shares, fruit share, meat share)
2. Near real-time information on the farm's offerings for sale in the open market
3.  Connection points for the customer to pick up farm offerings 
    - drop off locations, farm stands, farmers' market
    - day and time
4. Farm location (geolocation) and description (a window-shopping portal for the farm)

### Stakeholder Types 
* Farmers
* Customers of farm products
* Suppliers to farmers

### Real stakeholder 1
* Ari Kurtz, 70, Male, and Moira O'Donnel, 65, Female 
* Occupation: Farmers, in Lincoln MA
Ari and Moira grow many types of vegetables and fruits during the farming season. They runs a CSA (Community supported agriculture) and also sells produce in the farmer's market. they also give a part of their produce to a local charity. As a farmer they offers CSA subscriptions through a mailing list and the local newspaper of the town. They have experienced the following problems: 
    - Outreach: Over the past few years they has seen their CSA membership decline. As a farmer outreach is a big challenge especially in the digital era, where the proportion of people accessing information through the traditional media is limited. Also maintaining a website is difficult.
    - Marketing excess produce: When there is surplus produce like hot peppers this year, the issues they face are 
        - They find it very difficut to find someone to buy them, whether small quantities or in bulk. They rely on a mailing list that most farmers in Massachusetts subscribe to, to market their produce
        - How to price the product so that it is attractive enough to buy, but at the same time they are not losing money. They compare prices in local stores and gustimate a selling price for their produce
        - How to make inventory available in realtime to customers  

### Real stakeholder 2
* Vijaya Meduri: Age 43, Female
* Occupation: Home maker, Acton MA
Vijaya is married and has a toddler and her spouse is a software professional. She is primarily responsible for providing food to her family. She is passionate about sourcing food from her local community. She buys fresh seasonal produce from locals farms and farm stands. The rough breakup  is 70% from the grocery store and 30% local farms, but she would like to increase the latter. She currently subscribes to a CSA but she also shops for produce that were scarce in her share or those she wants to store through winter. She gets her information in the following ways:
    - A mailing list where farmers advertise and request anything and everything to do with farming and fresh produce
    - Websites such as https://massnrc.org/farmlocator/map.aspx?Type=Organic%20Farms
    - pickyourown.org

She then calls individual farms to see what is availabe to buy/pick at that time (day or week) before heading there. She loves the fact that she is able to connect with her food source and also bring her child along to participate and play as an activity.

Her problems are: 
    - She has to spend a lot of time hunting for what she wants to buy locally.
    - While she is familiar with a few farms locally there are many around that she doesn't know of and what they offer.

She would like to have a website that gives her up to date information she needs about local farms within 20 miles from her home, their offerings and how and when she can buy produce from them. The most important aspect of buying from local farms is the sense of community and connection she feels with the local people.

### Ficticious stakeholder 3

* Mary Manhannan: Age 44 Female
* Occupation: Farmer in Pittsfield MA
Mary is a new farmer who is has taken a new entry farmers training program offered by the Tufft's University. As a part of the program she has been given land to grow vegetables and hopes to run a small CSA with a few members as an experiment. As a new entrant she needs the following:
    - A portal to host and market her virtual farm
    - Ability to sell CSA shares online and attract customers
If her venture works out she hopes to eventually lease some land and make farming her full time profession

### Product Backlog
Our product backlog will be managed using Jira (https://txmd-webops.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MYF/boards/1/backlog). We currently have more than 10 PBIs and they are all expressed as a true user story. We ordered the backlog based on the functionality that is needed to create a fluid and logical user experience ("Business Value"), and then taking into account pre-requisite/dependencies between tasks.

#### Definition of ready for our user stories
- Has a title
- Is a testable user story
- Is Estimated
- Has clear and unambigous acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and pre-requisites are ready
- Has additional details
- Has been discussed at sprint planning and team agrees the story is complete (it has an opening sentence and additional details are added) and meets the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small & Testable) criteria

#### Estimation technique
We used the affinity estimation method using buckets/categories on a scale of 1 (Smallest) through 5 (Largest). The developers estimated the first 10 PBIs in story points using relative sizing and grouped them into each bucket. For example, while a PBI with an estimate of 2 story points was placed in bucket 1, a PBI with an estimate of 6 (3x) story points was placed in bucket 3.

Only developers participated in estimating each PBI. 

A recording of the Zoom session where we did most of this estimation can be viewed here : https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/share/7RBYFAdnjYFj7M_tqM7k6Ete0iwUiOPJSvVqJa8oiax1v3fMKXk3Ua7RgLjeHyHi.oCFtfjU87kVOR5-V. 
Some of the estimation and grouping was done asynchronously via Slack. 

## Project Part 2
### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning took place on Nov. 1 - all members participated in the session; however, **only the developers participated in the forecast exercise.**

The session was divided in three parts: 1) Why is this Sprint valuable, 2) What can be done this Sprint and 3) How will the chosen work get done:

#### 1) Why is this Sprint Valuable
This sprint is valuable because it will allow us to understand the Minimum Viable Product from our main stakeholder's perspective, and because it will allow the Team to develop the technical foundation to develop the solution.
##### Sprint Goal: To allow a farmer to log in and create a farm.

#### 2) What can be done this Sprint?
The team reviewed the stories in the backlog and decided to focus on the minimum functionality required by the farmer to login to the MyFarm system and create a new farm. In addition, the team decided that the Django framework will allow pretty quick development of the MVP; since not all of the developers are familiar with Django, a use story was added to train the team. The following stories were added to the Sprint: Django Training for the team; Research > Exploration Story - Add a location; Farmer - Create a New Account; Farmer - Portal Login; Farmer - Create a new farm; Farmer - Update Farm Information.

#### 3) How will the chosen work get done
Here the team developed the forecast for the Sprint.

##### Forecast

The forecast for the number of story points the team can complete during the sprint is 20. The number is an "educated guess" based on the developers' assesment on learning and applying the technology for the project and prior experience with databases and the web forms to create and save the data.

- You pulled stories into your sprint backlog: YES
- You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog: YES
- The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast: YES
- Only developers participated in the pointing activity: YES

- You decomposed user stories into developer tasks: YES 
- The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog: YES. Developer tasks are attached to each story.

Our sprint backlog is shown above. The URL of the board is : https://txmd-webops.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MYF/boards/1. 

At the end of the meeting, the team pulled the stories as the top of the backlog into Sprint 1; we made sure that the aggregate size did not exceed the forecast.
