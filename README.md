### Far Vision

2. Subscription model information and number of slots available if any (e.g. CSA shares, fruit share, meat share)
3. Real-time information on the farm's offerings for sale in the open market
4. Connection points for the customer to pick up farm offerings 
    - drop off locations, farm stands, farmers' market
    - day and time
